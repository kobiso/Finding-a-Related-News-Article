He paid and was about to sit down to eat when an employee told him to stop. Apparently another employee really wanted that glazed and he was asked to return his donut. The man didn't want to because he was hungry. Police were called, the man was knocked unconscious, his donut removed, and his body dragged from the store so that the other employee could enjoy the glazed donut they'd sold to the now-unconscious man in peace.

Idk why, but it felt right to comment this here... On a United post. OHHHHH I remember why. Because that donut was a seat on a United flight, but everything else was the exact same.",-0.3,3.6
