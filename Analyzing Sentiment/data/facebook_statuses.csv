comment: ,"Happy New Year. Here is a short story I wrote for my grandchildren. I hope you all enjoy it. You can substitute the names for your kids. :) 
Once upon a time there were two young children named Mya and Jordan. Jordan and Mya were brother and sister. 
They lived far away from their pop pop who loved them more than candy. Pop pop had gardens of food and fruits
that they could eat when ever they wanted. 
Also pop pop had chickens to play with. One day while Jordan and Mya were playing in the back yard, pop pop fell asleep 
in his chair under a shady tree. 
A small red fox sneaked into the yard and was trying to get into the chicken coop to eat the chickens.
Mya heard the chickens making a ruckus and said,""Hey jordan, something is going on in the chicken coop"". 
The two of them jumped up at the same time and began to run towards the coop. When they got closer, Jordan
saw the fox.
Being the best big brother a girl could ask for, he stopped Mya and told her to stay where she was, because she was 
safe there.
Then, he continued to the chicken coop. When he got there, the fox was trying to dig under the wire fencing. Jordan grabbed a long stick and
approached the fox.
""Go away fox"", yelled Jordan, ""these chickens are our friends"". The fox looked right into Jordans eyes. His heart sank
a bit with fear, and then, 
he stood up straight and ran straight toward the fox, swinging the stick back and forth to scare him away. The fox didn't budge.
Then the fox began to dig again. Jordan thought for 
a moment and then he had a plan. ""Mya"", Jordan called. ""Yes Jordan"" said Mya. ""What do you want""? ""I need you to go by the little
pool and fill the water guns, so we can shoot the fox and save pop pops
chickens"" said Jordan. Mya ran to the small pool. She picked up the squirt guns and stuck them under the water. When they were full, 
she plugged the ends and ran as fast as she could
to the side of coop wher Jordan was waiting. ""Ok"" said Jordan, ""when I count to three, we start shooting the fox"". Mya
looked at Jordan with tears in her eyes.
""Jordan"" she said, ""the fox is so cute, I don't want to hurt it"". ""But"" said Jordan, ""these are only water guns to scare him"". ""Even
so"", said Mya, ""I don't want to scare him either"". ""Well than, what do you suggest we do Mya""? Said Jordan. 
""well if he is trying to eat the chickens, maybe he is hungry. Let's give him something else to eat and
maybe he will leave the chickens alone"". ""Ok"" said Jordan. ""Let's go see what pop pop has that we can feed him"".
The two children scurried up the deck stairs and into the kitchen. Imediately Mya saw Sparky's bowl. Sparky 
was pop pops lazy old dog.
""Jodan"", said Mya, ""we can feed the fox Sparky's food"". ""Allright"" he said, ""let's see what happens"". Jordan opened the 
cabinet and grabbed a clean bowl.
Mya got a cup from the cubboard, stuck it down into the food bag and filled the bowl. The door flew open
and they were down the stairs and back to the coop in no time at all. 
Mya placed the bowl on the ground near as she could to the fox, who had by now almost dug under the fence. 
The fox looked into Mya's wide eyes, she starred intently back at him. She said, ""this food is for you mr fox"".
The fox smelled the food and it seemed he was interested in exploring the bowl to see what it was. In a few
seconds the little fox was eating Sparky's dog food from the bowl the children gave him.
He gobbled it all up in just a few minutes. Then the fox slowly walked closer to where Mya and Jordan were 
standing watching him eat. He rubbed up against their legs like a cat and then dashed away into the wooded lot
next to the garden. Just then pop pop woke up. The kids told Pop pop of their wonderful adventure with the 
chickens and the fox. ""We saved the chickens"" said jordan proudly. ""And"" said mya, ""we made a new friend"". ""Sure you did"", 
said pop pop with a grin. ""You are the best little helpers a pop pop ever had. I love you both so much"". ""Ok"" 
said pop pop, ""after that adventure, I bet you two are hungry like the fox. Let's go have dinner, and you can tell me the 
whole story again and again"". The end."
