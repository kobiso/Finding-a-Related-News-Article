2017-04-10T00:28:37+0000,"Update for Trump voters.  1. He said he wouldnt bomb Syria. You bought it. Then he bombed Syria.   2. He said he'd build a wall along the border with Mexico. You bought it. Now his secretary of homeland security says ""Its unlikely that we will build a wall.""  3. He said hed clean the Washington swamp. You bought it. Then he brought into his administration more billionaires, CEOs, and Wall Street moguls than in any administration in history, to make laws that will enrich their businesses.  4. He said hed repeal Obamacare and replace it with something wonderful. You bought it. Then he didnt.  5. He said hed use his business experience to whip the White House into shape. You bought it. Then he created the most chaotic, dysfunctional, back-stabbing White House in modern history, in which no one is in charge.    6. He said hed release his tax returns, eventually. You bought it. He hasnt, and says he never will.  7. He said hed divest himself from his financial empire, to avoid any conflicts of interest. You bought it. He remains heavily involved in his businesses, makes money off of foreign dignitaries staying at his Washington hotel, gets China to give the Trump brand trademark and copyright rights, manipulates the stock market on a daily basis, and has more conflicts of interest than can even be counted.  8. He said Clinton was in the pockets of Goldman Sachs, and would do whatever they said. You bought it. Then he put half a dozen Goldman Sachs executives in positions of power in his administration.  9. He said hed surround himself with all the best and smartest people. You bought it. Then he put Betsy DeVos, opponent of public education, in charge of education; Jeff Sessions, opponent of the Voting Rights Act, in charge of voting rights; Ben Carson, opponent of the Fair Housing Act, in charge of fair housing; Scott Pruitt, climate change denier, in charge of the Environmental Protection Agency; and Russian quisling Rex Tillerson as Secretary of State.  10. He said hed faithfully execute the law. You bought it. Then he said his predecessor, Barack Obama, spied on him, without any evidence of Obama ever doing so, in order to divert attention from the FBI's investigation into collusion between his campaign and Russian operatives to win the election.  11. He said he knew more about strategy and terrorism than the generals did. You bought it. Then he promptly gave the green light to a disastrous raid in Yemen- even though all his generals said it would be a terrible idea. This raid resulted in the deaths of a Navy SEAL, an 8-year old American girl, and numerous civilians. The actual target of the raid escaped, and no useful intel was gained.  12. He called Barack Obama the vacationer-in-Chief and accused him of playing more rounds of golf than Tiger Woods. He promised to never be the kind of president who took cushy vacations on the taxpayers dime, not when there was so much important work to be done. You bought it. He has by now spent more taxpayer money on vacations than Obama did in the first 3 years of his presidency. Not to mention all the money taxpayers are spending protecting his family, including his two sons who travel all over the world on Trump business.  13. He called CNN, the Washington Post and the New York Times fake news and said they were his enemy. You bought it. Now he gets his information from Fox News, Breitbart, Gateway Pundit, and InfoWars.  More to come.",0,15.3

2017-04-10T02:55:39+0000,"1. Obama lawfully seeks approval for missile strikes in Syria after Assad horrifically gassed his own people in 2013. The speaker of the house, Republican John Boehner, is on board but says Obama will have to rally support. A whip count was taken before taking it to the floor and 183 Republicans said they would vote NO to a missile strike so it didn't go to the floor.  2. During this time, DJT tweets 18 times about how Obama should not order missile strikes, how he has to have to have congressional approval, it's a waste of money, it does nothing for the US, fix America, America first, blah blah blah. 3. Not getting his wish, Obama chooses to go the diplomacy route instead of just ordering the strike anyway, works with the Russians, and convinces Assad to hand over the chemical weapons. No more chemical strikes happen during the rest of his presidency.  4. DJT becomes President running on a promise that he will not intervene in other countries, that he will be the President of the United States, not of the world, the rest of the world is on their own, blah, blah, blah.  5. After DJT wins the presidency, he tries twice to ban Syrian refugees from entering our country, and is ready to take this up to the Supreme Court. Meanwhile Syrians are getting raped, tortured and murdered daily. (Not our problem.) 6. Fast forward to this week... our Secretary of State, the wonderfully incompetent Rex Tillerson, finally speaks on camera and says that Assad can remain in power and that the Syrians will have to decide what they want. (You know the ones.....the defeated men and women with beautiful babies and children of God who are getting brutally murdered every day and are not welcome in our country.) 7. Mere days after Tillerson makes these statements, Assad gasses his own people.  8. With historically low approval ratings, federal investigations, the republicans going nuclear and blowing up the Senate, a horrible jobs report to be unveiled the next day, Trump pulls his ""War distracts and helps poll numbers"" card, wags the dog, and bombs a Syrian airfield. Does this secretly, without congressional approval, but let's a dictator... an adversary of the US, who is in cahoots with Syria, know ahead of time.  9. Trump addresses the nation on what he had done, and says it was the images of beautiful babies and the children of God that changed his mind. (You know the ones....the ones he's trying to ban from entering our country.) 10. Trump blames Obama.""",-0.1,7.9

Many games were played with a stick and ball  As far back as the early days of man  Till the 14th century, golfers teed off  At St. Andrews Scotland, with clubs in hand.  Today men and women both play golf  As a group or just one or two.  Players rich, poor, pro or in between  Practice their swing with clubs, old and new.  They don't go thirsty cause they bring their own  Whatever it takes to enjoy the day.  Sometimes they play several games at once  As they win money or give it away.  There's nothing better than a green golf course  With the sweet scent of spring in the air.  To escape the drudgery of the workplace  Where you can laugh, joke, brag, gamble and swear.

For what looks to be a United Airlines gaff. I agree with a past post that United could have paid to fly their 4 very important staff on another carrier. If they say they can offer up to $1300 or so to each passenger for being bumped off a flight, surely it's in their interests both financially and marketing-wise to just buy 4 airline tickets for those 4 staff members and save this kind of embarrassment.  It was heavily reported that it's the captain that makes the decision: who goes, who stays and everyone including paying customers have to simply follow his orders without question. I doubt it makes any difference at all to the pilot who he carries unless a passenger is disruptive or a threat to life. Nah, the captain was given his orders by the airline, his employer. Total disgrace! So United is trying damage limitation by laying blame with the captain and insulting everyone's intelligence.

2017-04-11T06:10:31+0000,"Story from Wiki just a cut and paste On April 9, 2017, United Airlines Flight 3411 was operated by an Embraer E170 flying from Chicago O'Hare (ORD) to Louisville (SDF). Before departure, but after passengers had boarded and were seated, United bumped four passengers to make way for four United Airlines staff members who needed to get to a connection point.[1] Passengers were offered up to $800 to take a later flight, but with no volunteers, a manager boarded and selected four people to leave the flight. One of the four passengers selected for removal refused to leave. United Airlines staff requested assistance from police officers from the Chicago Department of Aviation. In the ensuing scuffle, the passenger suffered injuries to his head and mouth, and was taken to hospital with non-life threatening injuries.[2]  Background	  The later flight offered by United Airlines was scheduled for the next day at 3 p.m., while this overbooked service was on a Sunday night. The loss of an entire working day might have contributed to the lack of uptake of the offer. Furthermore, the passenger that refused to leave, and was injured, claimed to be a physician with patients he needed to see.[3]  Aftermath	  United C.E.O. Oscar Munoz tweeted: This is an upsetting event to all of us here at United. I apologize for having to re-accommodate these customers. Our team is moving with a sense of urgency to work with the authorities and conduct our own detailed review of what happened. We are also reaching out to this passenger to talk directly to him and further address and resolve this situation.[4] In a letter to employee, however, Munoz defended the crew's actions and claimed the passenger was ""disruptive and belligerent"".[5] One of the officers who removed and dragged the passenger was placed on administrative leave pending review. The Chicago Department of Aviation said that The incident on United flight 3411 was not in accordance with our standard operating procedure and the actions of the aviation security officer are obviously not condoned by the Department...[2]",-0.3,6

We have all so all experienced people who have been exceptionally nice. If the crew turned around after everyone had a boarded and explained that they needed to be re-position for the next day they should not have been allowed to board. Just like everyone else if you were late you cannot board. Once boarded The gate is closed.

Jesus said, ""I came so that everyone would have life, and have it in its fullest."" Jesus Christ is God's Son. He is the only One who can bring us back to God. Jesus died on the Cross and rose from the grave. He paid the penalty for our sin and bridged the gap between God and people.  ""There is only one God, and Christ Jesus is the only One who can bring us to God."" ""Christ died once for our sins. An innocent person died for those who are guilty. Christ did this to bring you to God."" Because we are sinners, we are condemned to death. For the wages of sin is death (Romans 6:23). This includes eternal separation from God. the Bible called it condenation and sorrow in hell and lake of fire the second death.  God has provided the only way  we must make the choice.  We must trust Jesus Christ to forgive our sins and receive Him as our Savior and serve Him as our Lord. ""As many as received Him, to them He gave the right to become children of God, even to those who believed on His name.""  Would you like to give your life over to Jesus Christ right now? If so, you can pray the following prayer and accept Jesus as your Savior:  Dear Lord Jesus,  I know that I am a sinner and need Your forgiveness. I believe that You died on the cross for my sins and rose from the grave to give me life. I know You are the only way to God. So now I want to quit disobeying You and start living for You. Please forgive me, change my life and show me how to know You. In Jesus' name. Amen.  Spend time with God each day. It does not have to be a long period of time. Just develop the daily habit of praying to Him and reading His Word. Ask God to increase your faith and your understanding of the Bible.Seek fellowship with other followers of Jesus.

I don't know why the media didn't bother to check with UA or the DOT website...RULE 25 DENIED BOARDING COMPENSATION Denied Boarding (U.S.A./Canadian Flight Origin) - When there is an Oversold UA flight that originates in the U.S.A. or Canada, the following provisions apply: Request for Volunteers UA will request Passengers who are willing to relinquish their confirmed reserved space in exchange for compensation in an amount determined by UA (including but not limited to check or an electronic travel certificate). The travel certificate will be valid only for travel on UA or designated Codeshare partners for one year from the date of issue and will have no refund value. If a Passenger is asked to volunteer, UA will not later deny boarding to that Passenger involuntarily unless that Passenger was informed at the time he was asked to volunteer that there was a possibility of being denied boarding involuntarily and of the amount of compensation to which he/she would have been entitled in that event. The request for volunteers and the selection of such person to be denied space will be in a manner determined solely by UA. Boarding Priorities - If a flight is Oversold, no one may be denied boarding against his/her will until UA or other carrier personnel first ask for volunteers who will give up their reservations willingly in exchange for compensation as determined by UA. If there are not enough volunteers, other Passengers may be denied boarding involuntarily in accordance with UAs boarding priority: Passengers who are Qualified Individuals with Disabilities, unaccompanied minors under the age of 18 years, or minors between the ages of 5 to 15 years who use the unaccompanied minor service, will be the last to be involuntarily denied boarding if it is determined by UA that such denial would constitute a hardship.

2017-04-28T17:56:54+0000,"Christians are persecuted everywhere. Behold, for I wish to prove a point. Observe:  God loves you so so much. He loves you and did something amazing by sending Jesus to die for you. Let me explain:   When you were young, God gave you a conscience. He allowed you to understand what is right and wrong. You knew that lying, stealing, cheating etc. was wrong. God taught you His way of truth and He laid out two paths for you. You could either follow Him and live a perfect and holy life or you could follow your own way. By sinning (doing the things God said not to do), you chose your own way, the evil way. The Bible says:   ""But the cowardly, the unbelieving, the vile, the murderers, the sexually immoral, those who practice magic arts, the idolaters and all liars--their place will be in the fiery lake of burning sulfur. This is the second death."" God is just and since He is a just judge, He is obligated to punish those who do evil things.  If you look back on your life, have you ever hated anyone? The Bible says ""anyone who hates his brother is a murderer.""   If God is just He must punish you. However, God deeply loves you. He created you, you are the imagination of His heart. Therefore, God came up with a plan.   He made Himself into a man by the name of Jesus. Jesus was born and lived like any of us. Then, He Himself as Jesus, lived a perfect life, never sinning even once. He never did evil things or even once gave in to temptation. He lived a perfect life but during His life He was persecuted of men. Finally, evil men tortured and killed Him by nailing His to a cross.   God allowed this to happen for you. Let me explain.   God should have punished you for your sins but He punished Jesus instead of you. He poured out all His anger and wrath on Jesus, the innocent One, who died in your place.   Since Jesus offered Himself as a substitute for you, you can now go free. You no longer have to pay for your sins.  If you make a decision today, to turn from your sin and follow Jesus, God will forgive your sin and allow you to enter heaven instead of the lake of fire. Turn from sin and make a decision to follow Jesus and love others instead and God will forgive you through the blood of Jesus.   Please make this decision and pray with me now:  Lord Jesus, I recognize that I have sinned. I ask you Lord to forgive me my sin. I choose to turn from sin and follow you. I choose to live for you, and spread your Word. I choose to be your servant and spread your love. I thank you Lord that you died in my place. I thank you for forgiving me my sin. In Jesus name I pray. Amen. God asks that we turn from sin, from selfish evil ways and that we take up the new purpose of following Him. If you have made a decision today to turn from your old life, know this, God has forgiven all your sins. Just send us an inbox message to tell us if you have prayed the prayer.

THE GOSPEL:Steps on how to get saved. Romans 3:10-12  10 As it is written: There is none righteous, no, not one; 11 There is none who understands; There is none who seeks after God. 12 They have all turned aside; They have together become unprofitable; There is none who does good, no, not one.  Romans 3:23  23 for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God,  Romans 6:23  23 For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord. Hebrews 9:27 (without Jesus you will go to hell judged for each sin. Hell is a place of torment and it's forever. Choose heaven where there is no more death, no more disease, no more famine, no more evil). 27 And as it is appointed for men to die once, but after this the judgment,   Romans 5:8 8 But God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us.   John 3:16-18  16 For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life. 17 For God did not send His Son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world through Him might be saved. 18 He who believes in Him is not condemned; but he who does not believe is condemned already, because he has not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God. John 14:6 Jesus said to him, I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through Me. John 11 Jesus said to her, I am the resurrection and the life. John 3. Jesus said you MUST be born again to enter God's Kingdom John 8:58 I AM : Jesus claims to be God. 1 Timothy 2:5 5 For there is one God and one Mediator between God and men, the Man Christ Jesus, Salvation is 100% from God a guft you can accept or refuse and below is what to do. We are saved by grace and not by actions or works (Ephesians 2) but is a gift from God. The Bible says that our best of works are as filthy rags to God and only the blood of Jesus shed for us has saving power. Mark 8:36-38  36 For what will it profit a man if he gains the whole world, and loses his own soul?37 Or what will a man give in exchange for his soul?  Romans 10:9-10 9 that if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved. 10 For with the heart one believes unto righteousness, and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. :: Admit to God you are a sinner, tell God you believe He sent His Son Jesus to pay for your sins and died on the cross and was then raised from the dead. Ask Jesus to be the Lord and Savior of your life. You are now saved so read your Bible daily and obey best as can repenting of sin when you mess up (we all do only God is perfect).1 John 1:9  9 If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.  Ephesians 1. 13 In Him you also trusted, after you heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation; in whom also, having believed, you were sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise, 14 who is the guarantee of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession, to the praise of His glory.  Jesus on the cross said It is finished in other words salvation is a mission accomplished. If you have accepted salvation, it's the best thing ever this side of eternity with heaven and no more condemnation, death or wrath assured.Be sure to get baptised and if possible find a good Bible believing church.  You are free. The truth shall set you free. Jesus is the truth the way the life.",0,12.7

Mexico is gonna one day, possible, probably pay for the wall in some form, and now South Korea should pay for a $1billion defense system.   He handed Germany an invoice.  He's upping the defense budget to a ludicrous amount.  He's cutting funding for almost everything else that protects the citizens from pollutants.   He wants to revive the coal industry, which every other country is turning away from.   And he created 35 whopping jobs for the pipeline but killed almost 5000 jobs with his hiring freezes, funding halts and budget cuts from just the EPA.   His budget cuts would also give less grant money to cities for clean tap water, ooh and Flint still doesn't have new pipes. STILL.   The Republicans have failed miserably with the healthcare reform, and they're not even trying to hide their greed and contempt for the working class anymore.   He's made it legal for companies to dumb coal sludge in our waters, he's made it legal to hunt bears and wolves while they're hibernating in their dens and this includes their cubs and pups.   He has removed the equal and fair pay act and in doing so he also took away sexual harassment protection in the work place for women. (This one alone should make a point because this law was solely there so women get treated equally and can't get sexually harassed. The only reason there is to remove this bill is so that you can pay women less and make it harder on women when sexual assault happens in the work place. That was simply a dick move.)   His tax plan will drop corporate tax from 35% to 15%. And Individuals making more than $500 000 a year will also see a tax cut.  BUT it was said that there's no guarantee that the working class won't take a hit.    Let's see.... ooh he has threatened to shut down the government if Democrats don't repeal Obamacare, but then he goes on a Twitter rant about how democrats want to take money from national parks and shut down the government. Even though it's HIS budget cuts that are threatening the parks. His cuts to the EPA is a threat to the parks and HE wants to shut down the government during a hissy fit.

2017-04-28T09:12:43+0000,"THE WORLD REVOLUTION IS ONLY BEGINNING.  According to the organization Oxfam the global inequality crisis is reaching new extremes. The richest 1% now have more wealth than the rest of the world combined. Power and privilege is being used to skew the economic system in favor of the riches. The question here is who's keeping this devilish imbalanced order going on ? The Global Fraternal Network which gathers all the Masonic lodges worldwide represents some 6 million members controlling most of the key levers, mostly in the western countries. This stealthy organization tightly controls the western politics and medianetworks. As to sustain its huge body and its enormous endeavor - the New World Order - the Global Fraternal Networks needs a lot of money. This explains why it functions in symbiosis with notably the Oil Industry and the Weapon Industry which in turn have access to politics. This explains also why the world is endlessly in war and why Rex Tillerman, ex-CEO of ExxonMobil, is now Secretary of State.   Trump has been hired by Freemasonry for two reasons: on the one hand bringing down Vladimir Putin and the ransacking the Middle East with its acolytes the two barbarian Wahabit regimes and Israe, and on the other hand denying Global Warming as to satisfy the Oil Lobbies and Industry. Yet, meanwhile, the IPCC is warning us that we must bring back our global CO2 emissions to 50% of what they were during the year 1990 and this before 2020, if we are to remain within the 2 degrees Celsius. But our global CO2 emissions continue rising year after year non stop: April 23, 2916: 407.95 ppm - April 23, 2017: 409.65 ppm.   The Freemasonry is the core and the cement of the abusive 1% that plunders the world and also the core of evil and anti-Nature perversity on our planet. It has created in 1983 the National Endowment for Democracy which has for OFFICIAL mission to remove the regimes that do not fit with the Masonic interests. The National Endowment for Democracy has notably organized and financed the revolt in Syria and this for three main reasons:   1) breaking the axis Tehran-Damascus-Hezbollah which frightened the two main allies of Washington in the Middle East, the Saudi regime and Israel. As to wipe out the Syrian regime Washington, the Saudi regime and the Qatari regime financed and armed ISIS and the Jabhat Al-Nusra. In 2014 at Harvard University, Joe Biden had these words: ""the Saudi regime financed ISIS with hundreds of million dollars and armed this terrorist organization with thousands of tons of weapons"". The British General Jonathan Shaw who led the SAS in Iraq, confirmed Biden's words.   In 2016 Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard revealed that the Obama administration financed and armed ISIS and the Jabhat Al-Nusra and Gabbard introduced the ""Stop Arming Terrorists Act"" for this very reason. Also in 2016, the 28 pages revealed that the Saudi prince Bandar Ben Sultan and his wife financed the commando that sent the 2 jetliners in the Twin Towers and that the link between the Saudi prince and the commando was a certain Osama Bassan himself a member of Al-Qaeda. The very same year Obama made use of his presidential veto to protect the Saudi regime against the families of the 9/11 victims.   2) the second reason was that Freemasonry wanted to build a Gas pipeline from Qatar to the Mediterranean Sea through Syria as to compete with the Russian Gas Pipeline more in the north.  3) the third reason was to bring a new piece to the creation of a Great Kurdistan proposed by the Freemason Zbigniew Brzezinski and encroaching on the lands of Turkey, Iraq, IRAN and Syria. This few examples just to show how deeply criminal is Freemasonry which protects the abusive 1%. Generating chaos in the world. Recently Pope Francis warned the riches of this planet and called them to change their behavior or be ready to disappear.   The world revolution is only beginning, do not choose the wrong side of the 1%.  Patrick Ali Pahlavi",0,10.5

2017-04-28T15:33:45+0000,"So, a few facts. Regardless of North Koreas nuclear capabilities, they have enough heavy artillery within range of Seoul, South Korea to raze the city to the ground and kill thousands. North Korea would only need to land one or two low yield nuclear warheads on Seoul to kill hundreds of thousands of innocent men, women and children. While North Korea would most certainly lose any military confrontation with the United States, they could inflict heavy damage to South Korea and Japan and kill millions.  There is one problem with all of this however. China is not going to sit back and allow a preemptive strike against North Korea by the United States. If Trump thinks for a minute he can bully China, he is in for one hell of a shock. Neither will Russia allow it for that matter. If you dont think China and/or Russia can stop us, think again. Yes, we have the most advanced and power military in the world, no doubt. With China and/or Russia, it would not be a conventional conflict. It would go nuclear almost immediately. If you think our Missile Defense System will protect us, think again. It was never designed to defend against a massive nuclear strike.   Russia alone has enough nuclear firepower to turn the United States into an uninhabitable radioactive wasteland and China is no slouch either. China has the Dong Feng-5 ICBM, it carries 3 to 5 warheads of 5 megatons each. You drop one of those warheads on a city like Los Angeles and 2 million people reach 10,000 degrees Fahrenheit in less than a second. Another 4 million would be severely burned and dying or dead. Peak overpressures of 20psi would spread out over 28 square miles. Overpressures of 20psi are instantly fatal to humans and will severely damage if not destroy reinforced concrete buildings. Overpressures of 5psi would spread out over 170 square miles. Overpressures of 5psi will destroy most residential structures and the fatality rate is almost 90%. I havent even talked about the heat blast, or the air blast, or the radiation. Keep in mind, this is just one warhead, just one.  This is not a game folks, this is as real as it gets. Iraq and Afghanistan were nothing. If we launch a preemptive strike against North Korea and China responds, which they most certainly will. You can also bet Putin would respond to back up China. We will be looking at a global nuclear exchange. The exchange would kill, by most estimates, 2/3rds of the worlds human population. The after math of the exchange would destroy the base of the photosynthetic food chain, sending a wave of extinction across the Tree of Life. It is likely, by most estimate, humanity would end at the current generation.   So, if you think Trump has a good idea, I invite you to look at the big picture and reconsider. He would lead the world to that which is has tried to avoid for over 60 years, nuclear Armageddon. Why else do you think President's Clinton, Bush, and Obama have avoided a military confrontation with North Korea? They understood the consequences, it is clear Trump either doesn't understand, or simply doesn't care.",0,11.1

Its human breath that promotes most fame  Often unwholesome and abused.  The perfume of good deeds projects fame  Performed by those with great passion.  Not by persons in corrupt temples  Whose honesty, they must ration.  FELLOW AMERICANS  Will we battle terrorism, as it should be fought  Or run away and let evil doers chase us to our door?  Will we protect our freedom and system of life  As our fathers and grandfathers sacrificed before?  Will we secure our borders against illegal entry  Or let our economy and security be destroyed?  Will we finally stop runaway wasteful spending  By leaders who are self-serving and void?  Will we continue to pledge our help to the less fortunate  Who suffer from war, hunger and disease?  Will we preserve our heritage and our future  From those who wish to bring liberty to its knees?  Never be afraid to be proud of America  And march with the thankful, honorable and just.  Never surrender our freedom of choice  Standing firm for what we believe and trust.  Toms 1,1350 Poems Are Free To Share!  By God's Poet  Tom Zart  Most Published Poet  On The Web!

All the countries in negative interest rates and fake money printing will eventually turn bad for them.  Socialist countries will continue to raise taxes to get out of the hole and try to eliminate cash to control the monetary system like India.  We will remain a smart capitalist country.  Capitalism made us the strongest and biggest-  globalization Marxist socialist would have made us weak eventually imposing a big taxpayer system up to 50 percent and debt ridden.,-0.2,2.4

Eg.... A friend of mine has been lobbying our government for some years now in an attempt to offer Australians an alternative environmentally positive power solution and has been thwarted at every turn! His (proven) technology is essentially to  extract the methane emissions from organic waste dumps and convert to electricity and sell to the market at extremely cheaper prices than AGL etc.... But no surprise ... The government and big power companies have united and block him. A self funded Australian owned company employing around 100 people! Hmmmm this is just one rat I've smelled...

This represents 13% of the undiscovered oil in the world. Of the estimated totals, more than half of the undiscovered oil resources are estimated to occur in just three geologic provinces  Arctic Alaska, the Amerasian Basin, and the East Greenland Rift Basins.[1][2][3] More than 70% of the mean undiscovered oil resources is estimated to occur in five provinces: Arctic Alaska, Amerasia Basin, East Greenland Rift Basins, East Barents Basins, and West GreenlandEast Canada. It is further estimated that approximately 84% of the undiscovered oil and gas occurs offshore. The USGS did not consider economic factors such as the effects of permanent sea ice or oceanic water depth in its assessment of undiscovered oil and gas resources. This assessment is lower than a 2000 survey, which had included lands south of the arctic circle.[1][2][3]A recent study carried out by Wood Mackenzie on the Arctic potential comments that the likely remaining reserves will be 75% natural gas and 25% oil[citation needed]. It highlights four basins that are likely to be the focus of the petroleum industry in the upcoming years: the Kronprins Christian Basin, which is likely to have large reserves, the southwest Greenland basin, due to its proximity to markets, and the more oil-prone basins of Laptev and Baffin Bay. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroleum_exploration_in_the_Arctic",0,2.2

ANF - AL GLER  BRUSSELS  Sunday, 30 Apr 2017, 11:56 73 Turkish state's recent aerial attacks on YPG and YB positions and civilian areas in Rojava and Shengal, which came as YPG-led SDF continues its operations against ISIS in Rojava and Syria at full force, caused reactions.  Rojava's Democratic Union Party (Partiya Yekitya Demokrat, PYD) Co-president Saleh Moslem who also reacted against the attacks pointed out that Turkey carried out such attacks to give a breathing space to ISIS whenever it is left desperate in the battle with Kurdish forces.  We cannot fight on two fronts at the same time. This would put us under a strain. Coalition forces should declare Rojava airspace a no-fly zone in order for the elimination of threats by Turkey, said Moslem who also criticized international powers for not manifesting a strong reaction against Turkey.  PYD Co-president Saleh Moslem answered ANF's questions about Turkey's attacks on Rojava and Shengal, the approach of international powers and current subjects on the agenda.  ""TURKEY ATTACKS US WHENEVER ISIS REMAINS DESPERATE""  Turkey has launched several ground attacks on Rojava so far. Yet, the recent airstrike was the first one of its kind. How should this be evaluated? Is a new process underway?  It grabs attention that this recent attack of the Turks came after the referendum, through which he (Erdoan) seeks to portray himself as a sultan. To this end, he shows his power by carrying out such an attack. This airstrike came after Turkey's repeated ground attacks that targeted Efrn and surroundings at the border. It goes without doubt that these targets had been determined beforehand. Qereox is known to be the headquarters of YPG. The same thing also goes for Shengal. The hitting of peshmergas in particular is a message to the Kurds because it was a deliberate attack meant to intimidate the Kurds. It gives this message to international powers, the U.S. and Russia in the first place: ""I will destroy the Kurds"". This is an old plan of theirs anyway. When looked at the timing of Turkey's attacks, it is seen that Turkey attacks us every time ISIS gets trapped and remains desperate. This attack came while Tabqa is about to fall.""  You act with the International Coalition in Rojava and Syria. Significant advances have been made especially in the Raqqa operation. What is the reaction of these parties in the face of such an attack? There has been no serious reaction as much as was reflected in the press. Did you have a private conversation with them?  Turkey acts disingenuously. Short before the attack, it said both Russia and the U.S. that ""PKK is there, I will strike them"", which gives no respond opportunity to the other side. This latest attack was also conducted this way. Neither Russia nor the U.S. accepted it. There are things that are not reflected in the press. To the extend I know, the US Ambassador to Ankara also reacted against the attack. US commanders made inspections at the scene and voiced reactions. Yet, this reaction is not at the level we desire. Following this attack, people demand the declaration of Rojava a no-fly zone. If this is not done, Erdoan's attacks will continue.  ""ISIS ON ONE SIDE AND TURKEY ON THE OTHER""  What is it you want?  We demand a no-fly zone and we want Turkey to retreat from Rojava and Syria entirely. We do not want Turkey to intervene the region at all because of the fact that it has plans on the region and seeks to create a conflict. We want Turkey to keep its hands off Syria.  SDF and YPG made some statements that they could halt the Raqqa operation in the event that Turkey's attacks continue. Is there such a subject on the agenda?  There is ISIS on one side, and Turkey on the other. As a matter of fact, both sides are ISIS. Should such attacks continue, the situation will get hard at both fronts. YPG will then have to defend the people as they cannot fight ISIS by leaving the people to the mercy of Turkey. Our burden will be heavy.  What are your relations with the US and Russia like at the moment?  Our relations are within the framework of the deals we made before. In military terms, they are acting with the SDF. We are fighting terror with Russia in and around Efrn. Our agreements remain in effect. Both the US and Russia are against these policies of Turkey. They may remain silent due to some accounts but they are disturbed by Turkey's attacks and no side is pleased with Turkey's acts. Still, we do not trust any side. We will mount our defense ourselves.  Will Turkey's attacks be responded by your side?  Definitely, the attacks will not go unanswered. Our people are resisting, although not in the form of a regular army. Our people will resist just like they resisted in the process of Koban battle. The attacks conducted by Turkey two days ago were responded.  There is almost no country left in the Middle East and even the world with which Turkey did not have problems. All sides are disturbed by Turkey. However, the KDP is acting with Turkey in this process. How would you comment this?  KDP is in the hands of Turkey, dependent on Turkey in all aspects, which is why they cannot act against it. KDP became a part of Turkey's policies on Rojava and Shengal. The Barzani family is completely basing on their familial interests and for this reason they remain in the arms of the enemy. This will make KDP lose in long term because the Kurdish people see this truth.  ""GERMANY SHOULD BAN THE TURKISH FLAG""  YPG and YPJ became a symbol all around the world. However, Germany has banned their symbols. How do you evaluate this ban?  Today, all the world and European community stands with the Kurds. We have relations with these communities and their institutions, all of which show their solidarity with us. However, the situation changes when looked at the political interests of the states. The UK is selling weapons to Turkey and the same thing goes for Germany as well. They are doing such things to preserve these interests of theirs. However, we know that these symbols are raised all around the world today. If they are looking for a connection with terrorism, I believe that Germany should ban the Turkish flag first. It is Turkey that acts with terrorism, supports and harbors it. For this reason, Turkey's flag should be banned in Germany in the first place. German people are fond of YPG-YPJ flags rather than Turkey's flag. These bans are not judicial. We hope Germany will reverse this fault because it is an inconsistent and ridiculous decision. Our lawyers are dealing with this issue at the moment.  Responding to a motion submitted by German Left Party MP Ulla Jelpke, German Interior Ministry stated that ""We met with neither PYD Co-chairs nor representatives so far."" Did you have any meeting with German officials?  We as a party had no official meeting with them but we have an administration in Berlin, although not on behalf of the party directly. They also know this, and maintain relations in this framework. Yet, we had several meetings with German commissions, party leaders and parliamentarians up to date.",-0.1,31.4

Utah politicians--against the wishes of the vast majority of Utah citizens--are trying to steal national treasures including habitat for  endangered species and other wildlife, vital watersheds, national monuments, ancient petroglyphs and Native American sacred lands to sell and lease to their campaign donors.   These donors are a tiny minority of Utah citizens, but they are supported and financed by out of state interests.  Their campaign donations buy access by ensuring continuing political power for their legislating puppets. What do the puppeteers want for investing in the political careers of compliant politicians?  They want to drill, mine, log and graze national treasures for private profit.  They want their puppets to steal the birthright of every American to increase their own corporate profits. While 60%+ of the people of Utah oppose the legislative larceny being pushed by Bishop, Chaffetz, Lee and others, they are opposed by 80%+ of the owners of the lands--you, me and every other American citizen. With the full knowledge that they are acting against the will of the people, Utah politicians plan to pass their larcenous legislation with as little public scrutiny as possible.

According to the chemtrail conspiracy theory, long-lasting trails left in the sky by high-flying aircraft are chemical or biological agents deliberately sprayed for sinister purposes undisclosed to the general public. Believers in the theory argue that normal contrails dissipate relatively quickly, and contrails that do not dissipate must contain additional substances. These arguments have been dismissed by the scientific community as Conspiracy theories: such trails are normal water-based contrails that are routinely left by high-flying aircraft under certain atmospheric conditions. Although proponents have attempted to prove that the claimed chemical spraying does take place, their analyses have been flawed or based on misconceptions.  Because of the widespread popularity of the conspiracy theory, official agencies have received many inquiries from people demanding an explanation, and rarely do the authorities make attempts for Accountability to the public, citing its a conspiracy and not worth investigating. Believers in the conspiracy theory speculate that the purpose of the claimed chemical release may be solar radiation management, psychological manipulation, human population control, weather modification, or biological or chemical warfare, and that the trails are causing respiratory illnesses and other health problems.",-0.3,3.8

2017-04-29T21:21:37+0000,"Presented by three mathematicians - Dr Hannah Fry, Prof Norman Fenton and Prof David Spiegelhalter - it hones in on just three key numbers that clarify all the important questions around climate change. The stories behind these numbers involve an extraordinary cast of characters, almost all of whom had nothing to do with climate change, but whose work is critical to our understanding of the climate. The three numbers are: 0.85 degrees (the amount of warming the planet has undergone since 1880) 95 per cent (the degree of certainty climate scientists have that at least half the recent warming is man-made) 1 trillion tonnes (the total amount of carbon we can afford to burn - ever - in order to stay below 'dangerous levels' of climate change) Understanding how scientists came up with these three numbers gives a unique perspective on what we know about the past, present and future of our changing climate. The take away since 1880 we (planet earth) warmed .85 degree.137 or so years. And there is a 95% chance that .425 degree was man made....Time to HIT THE STREETS!!!!

2017-04-29T20:38:02+0000,"The only solution to save the Earth and climate change, responding to a complex scientific question in the field of water! What is the most difficult scientific question of global hydroelectric that no one scientists could the answer to it? Now the hard global question! How can we produce clean energy in a best way by the potential of water Static head in dams & seas that this water pressure can push to the center of planet? Answer: This is by getting benefit of joint scientific formula (E>P+1at) with immersion turbines method inside the water of dams & seas (Immersion turbines of series and parallel in zero point of opposite forces). (Ee>Ep+E1at) = (E>P+1at) Ee= High pressure clean energy that is produced by the water power plants in the depth of water via released fixed potential energy of water natural pressure (More than ten meters of water) with new method (Immersion turbines of series and parallel in zero point of opposite forces). Ep= Released fixed potential energy of water natural pressure in water depth (More than ten meters of water). E1at= Amount of energy that is consumed at a small pump of one atmosphere power is the ability (In the same place of the water power plant in water depth). Many scientists believe that the discovery of the formula is unparalleled. Although many still in shock! How this formula has not be discovered by scientists in the world. Answer to a hard question that scientists are searching for hundreds of years and they can control of climate change and stop global warming soon.

Dear Lord, thank You, that You are still on the Throne and that prayer can still change things...I thank You for answered prayer and for appointing  Donald J. Trump as the leader of Your people and this great nation... Thank You, Father, that We the People came out in droves and elected Donald J. Trump by a landslide, regardless of what their lying, crooked popular vote says. There are those who would contest our votes, contest the Will of Your People...We will not allow them to steal our future. You unclean, globalist, satanic, baby killers  and your evil cohorts won't be feathering your nests at our expense any more!...America has spoken loud and clear...CAN YOU HEAR US NOW???  There will be no perfect leader until Jesus returns, we know that. Until then, true Christians and true patriotic Americans are grateful to you, Father, for giving us a brave and strong leader in our new President. I have never been more grateful and more humbled in my life...I have never voted before, I have never cared before, but I promise I will never fail to exercise that God given right again...I want to say thank You, Jesus, for hearing our cries and for helping us avoid the greatest tragedy this nation has ever faced, and that is the loss of our sovereignty and being handed over to the New World Order Global Government, and we know that is the antichrist beast system....I am so proud of my fellow Americans for seeing through the lies and doing the right thing, and that is turning to You, Lord...thank You, Father, for moving the hearts of the people toward You and toward truth and good.  Good is making an open show of evil, but, we must and we will be vigilant, for we know it is not against flesh and blood that we fight, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places. We also fight against an ignorant, intentionally dumbed down world that has left so many ""unaware and compliant"" and easily manipulated.  We thank you, Father, that we will be able to stand in that Day, having done all to stand...We realize the danger has not passed and satan knows he has but a short time and he is lashing out in every direction and on every front...We must all pray that minds and hearts continue to open to Jesus...Four, even eight years roll around real fast...They almost caught us unaware this time; we will watch, we won' t let that happen again; we will not become complacent and go back to sleep. We hold our new leader, President Donald J. Trump, up to You and ask for Your Divine and Supernatural protection over him and his family at all times, particularly now, when those that seek to harm him and our nation are so desperate...the criminals are being cornered like rats; they will lash out violently and desperately.  Lord, You said You would confound the plans of the wicked and lay the crooked path straight...and, Lord, for those who disparage our President because they say You would never appoint such a person, to them I say read the Word of God...time after time, the Lord has used imperfect men to achieve His end...Moses, Paul and David were all murderers...Paul murdered hundreds if not thousands of Christians, yet the Lord used them in mighty ways...or, consider Cyrus, he was a pagan Persian King who God used to release the Israelites out of Babylonian captivity and even helped them to rebuild Jerusalem and the temple. ...right now, our country needs a Chief Executive Officer and a born leader, not a Pastor...we have enough of those and most are evil wolves in sheep's clothing... to these naysayers, these Pharisees, I say, put your stones back in your pocket...I thank You for this and in all things. Vengeance is Yours, Father, and soon, the wicked that mock You and our President and seek to destroy him and our American way of life, shall have their reward... in Jesus' Sweet Name I pray...Amen.  Even so, come quickly, Lord Jesus...I had a wide awake, open vision of the Lord's return in 1976 when I was 13 years old. This July was 40 years since that date... Thank you for taking time to view and share...the hour is late, the harvest is great, but the laborers are few...Maranatha!...https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt--TNZzsxc&list=LLtysruP3VK3vCcmWldmrz6g&index=",0.1,9

2017-05-08T06:06:46+0000,"*Daily Manna:* *********************************  MONDAY MAY 8
  *Blessed Are Those Who Wait*
 *********************************  TEXT: ISAIAH 30:18-26
 Key verse:
 *_And therefore will the LORD wait, that he may be gracious unto you, and therefore will he be exalted, that he may have mercy upon you: for the LORD is a God of judgment: blessed are all they that wait for him (Isaiah 30:18)._*
  The world is accustomed to haste. Everyone prefers to travel on the fast lane, own fast cars, fast telephony, fast Internet connections and eat fast foods. With the world wired together by awesome communication technology into one small global village, many business and lifestyle decisions can be made in no time by the touch of a gadget. The world is filled with the plague of impatience from coast to coast. Sadly, many Christians have contracted this syndrome and have been stung by the haste bug.
  God warned Israel about rebellion and lack of patience in waiting on Him. He informed them that in quietness and in confidence will their strength be after their repentance. He therefore promised to be gracious and merciful to them, if they will wait for Him.
  Waiting on the Lord, however, should not be assumed to mean stoppage of all efforts towards the realisation of ones set goals. Being patient for God to intervene in our affairs does not turn us into fatalistic believers, doing nothing and hoping for something. Waiting for God actually means turning to Him in prayers, trusting in His word for the things we desire, doing our best as may be required and looking up to Him, until He sends the blessings we ask for.
  Whatever the needs of our lives  child-bearing, marriage partner, marital bliss, good job, healing, personal spiritual growth, ministerial progress  waiting is an activity that involves the pursuit of God for the realisation of desires. Whoever waits on God must earnestly seek His face and stand upon His promises until the requests are granted. For our waiting to be fruitful therefore, it has to be accompanied by holiness and blamelessness, faith, courage, hope, patience and service unto the Lord.

If you want your ISP not to throttle your Netflix or Hulu then you better care about this. If you like open free market internet then you better say something. Because like all things Republican and Donald Trump they want America to go backwards.   #CivilWar2 it is coming. So instead let's let the south become it's own country. Give people 5 years to freely move back and forth. After that they will have to apply for citizenship. Unless you were born in the USA and we're a child and couldn't leave because of your parents. As long as you can prove you were born in the USA you can come over the border if you meet the criteria for that year. Over time their will be cut off and no one can get in unless you apply. #RemoveTheSouth   FIGHT BACK #FightBackTakeAmericaBack  FIGHT BACK #ThisIsOurCountry FIGHT BACK #EqualityForAll FIGHT BACK #AmericaMoveForwardNotBackwards FIGHT BACK #RemoveTheCorruptedGOP FIGHT BACK #FightForOurChildrensFuture FIGHT BACK #FightForEarthNotGreed FIGHT BACK #GoFCCYourSelf  https://www.google.com/amp/amp.timeinc.net/time/4770205/john-oliver-fcc-net-neutrality/%3Fsource%3Ddam,0,3.7
